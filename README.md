# youtube-social

This repository holds the code for a series of tutorials I'm writing on React + Next.js. The purpose is to build a web application where people can add YouTube videos to a queue and watch them together, with text chat. 

The written tutorials can be found both on [Medium](https://northkhalea.medium.com/) and [khalea.dev/blog](https://www.khalea.dev/blog).
